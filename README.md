# Crackle Mods
Collection of Crackle mods, downloaded/installed by the menu in Crackle.

## Submitting a mod
Of course, you'll need the mod. After that, fork this repo, add the mod in the "mods" directory as `[id].js`. Then, create a pull request with that fork to this repo, where we would look at the mod and make sure its fit. If it is, it'll be merged in the main repo where people can install it.

Mods are submitted over the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), if not said otherwise.

Submitting a UPDATE to a mod is the same, just fork the repo again, update the mod file, and make sure the commit, in its extra information, contains info about the new update. This will eventually be shown in the mod page in Crackle.
